# image-processing
Final project in image processing.
The models were trained on a set of roentgen images that were downloaded from kaggle. 
The images were of patients between the ages 0-19 years.
Contains three models that were created in order to predict the age of the patients in the images:
1. Linear Regression
2. MLP Regressor
3. CNN

We also created Auto Encoder model and used the Encoder to encode the images before sending them into the models.
